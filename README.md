# sshc

> ⚠️ This is a placeholder package.

The \`sshc\` package name is reserved for a future CLI tool that simplifies frequent SSH tasks like port forwarding, identity file handling, and host aliasing.

It is currently not functional and exists only to prevent name squatting and to secure the namespace for future development.

Stay tuned – something useful is coming soon. 🚀
